# Malware-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning
The relentless growth of malware threats has become a significant concern in the realm of cybersecurity. Traditional approaches to malware detection, such as signature-based methods, often struggle to keep pace with the ever-evolving landscape of malicious software. As a result, researchers and practitioners have turned to machine learning techniques as a promising avenue to enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of malware detection systems. This research focuses on the topic of "Malware Detection Using Machine Learning," with a particular emphasis on leveraging the Random Forest algorithm as the primary approach. Random Forest is an ensemble learning algorithm that combines multiple decision trees to create a robust and accurate model. Its ability to handle high-dimensional data, mitigate overfitting, and provide insights into feature importance make it a suitable choice for malware detection. This research aims to explore the application of Random Forest and related machine learning algorithms to develop an effective malware detection system with a web interface for ease of use and accessibility.
